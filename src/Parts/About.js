                    Hi! My name is Jayden No.
                    <br />
                    I am a full-stack web developer.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently live in  Vernon Hills, IL. I got into University as Statics major but decided to change course as a developer. I enjoy playing piano and violin time to time. I also love playing golf and tennis. If you are a gamer, I think we can have some fun times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experienced for both front-end and back-end, I look forward to do collaborative work to produce quality results. But I don't plan to stop there. I am always dedicated and interested to learn and apply new technologies to further improve everything.
                </p>
